1. Theory of Reality
This will be an essay examining what reality is

A â€“ Reality is a mental construction

Often when we talk about reality what we often mean is the physical world, the world we experience through our senses in our waking life. This physical world is the world we are gradually beginning to understand and explain using science.

However consider for a moment the objects you can see with your eyes right now, and indeed everything contained in your field of vision. Compare this to our imaginations of what the vision of an insect might look like.

Why do we only see one image in our minds instead of two? Our eyes provide two streams of raw visual data, but our sense of sight is not just this raw data. Indeed it isn't even an approximation of physical reality from this raw data, but a collection of mental concepts by which we understand this data in a variety of ways.

One of the easiest ways to see how the images in our mind are not simply the raw data from our eyes but actually something put together by our brains from that data is by checking out some simple optical illusions.

It is helpful to think of your brain as a computer, and your mind as one of many programs running on your computer brain. This computer is connected to lots of other pieces of hardware, such as your camera eyes, robot body and microphone ears. For your mind to work with them it needs special software, to stretch the metaphor drivers, to act as a translation service. To interact with them however as well as various drivers your mind also needs special interface software to provides the mental equivalent of a user interface.

Imagine the icons on your desktop PC at the moment. When you place an object in a folder on the screen or empty the waste basket you are under no illusion that somewhere in the workings of your PC a little waste basket or folder actually exists. These symbols make the complex and confusing world of the PC far easier to navigate, even though they are not true representations of the multitude of different binary states of the microchips in our PCs.

We cannot define reality as the physical world, reality is much better defined as the minds experience of various worlds through our senses. It is not completely correct to say that seeing and hearing are things you do with your eyes and ears. These are things you do with your brain, detecting photons and sound-waves is what you do with your eyes and ears. You still see and hear things in your dreams, but your eyes and ears play no part in this process.
