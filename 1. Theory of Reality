1. Theory of Reality
This will be an essay examining what reality is

A – Reality is a mental construction

Often when we talk about reality what we often mean is the physical world, the world we experience through our senses in our waking life. This physical world is the world we are gradually beginning to understand and explain using science.

However consider for a moment the objects you can see with your eyes right now, and indeed everything contained in your field of vision. Compare this to our imaginations of what the vision of an insect might look like.

Why do we only see one image in our minds instead of two? Our eyes provide two streams of raw visual data, but our sense of sight is not just this raw data. Indeed it isn't even an approximation of physical reality from this raw data, but a collection of mental symbols by which we understand this data in a variety of ways.

One of the easiest ways to see how the images in our mind are not simply the raw data from our eyes but actually something put together by our brains from that data is by checking out some simple optical illusions.

It is helpful to think of your brain as a computer, and your mind as one of many programs running on your computer brain. This computer is connected to lots of other pieces of hardware, such as your camera eyes, robot body and microphone ears. For your mind to work with them it needs special software, to stretch the metaphor drivers, to act as a translation service. To interact with them however as well as various drivers your mind also needs special interface software to provides the mental equivalent of a user interface.

Imagine the icons on your desktop PC at the moment. When you place an object in a folder on the screen or empty the waste basket you are under no illusion that somewhere in the workings of your PC a little waste basket or folder actually exists. These symbols make the complex and confusing world of the PC far easier to navigate, even though they are not true representations of the multitude of different binary states of the microchips in our PCs.

We cannot define reality as the physical world, reality is much better defined as the minds experience of various worlds through our senses. It is not completely correct to say that seeing and hearing are things you do with your eyes and ears. These are things you do with your brain, detecting photons and sound-waves is what you do with your eyes and ears. You still see and hear in dreams, but eyes and ears play no part in this process.

B – Consciousness & Reasoning

While each of our five senses has it's own little understood mental interface in our brain our minds are much more than just our sensory experiences, and the memories of those sensory experiences. 

When we describe something as alive, arguably we simply mean it meets the scientific criteria for being alive. At school we were taught this was MRS GREN, Movement – Respiration – Sensitivity – Growth – Reproduction – Excretion – Nutrition

However this can be boiled down to the four clearer criteria phenomena must meet to be considered alive.

1. Metabolism, the ability to take in energy from surroundings and keep going.
2. Homoeostasis, the ability to regulate itself and maintain stability.
3. Reproduction, the ability to create copies for preservation and continuation.
4. Adaptation, the ability to change from generation to generation.

Life appeared around 3.5 billion years ago. There is endless speculation about what exactly happened to create the first biological organism, but our existence today proves it must have taken place.  It is useful to draw a distinction between sentient life and conscious life. While some people use the terms sentient and conscious interchangeably I believe it is useful to understand them as  below.

Sentient (adjective)
1. Able to feel, see, hear, smell, or taste.
2. Finely sensitive in perception or feeling.

Conscious (adjective)
1. Aware of one's own existence, sensations, thoughts, surroundings, etc.
2. Capable of thought, will, or perception.

While life has always been sentient to some degree, even single celled organisms respond to the environment, it is unclear when it became conscious. While it is fairly easy to test for sentience by seeing if something can confirm in it's behaviour the ability to see or hear something, it is much harder to test for consciousness in the same way. 

Conscious life is able to have thoughts and think in a way that simple sentient life is not. When considering consciousness it is helpful to try to draw a distinction between the overlapping conscious processes of feelings, thoughts and concepts.

Feelings (noun)
1. the general state of consciousness considered independently of particular sensations, thoughts, etc. 
2. a consciousness or vague awareness: a feeling of inferiority.

Feelings are the rawest form of consciousness. I can never sufficiently express to another being what it is to feel lonely or in love, my only hope is that they have had a similar experiences and my be able to relate in this way if I try to explain my feelings to them.

Thought (noun)
1. meditation, contemplation, or recollection: deep in thought.
2. intention, design, or purpose, especially a half-formed or imperfect intention: We had some thought of eating.

Thoughts are a level of more specific contemplation above this. These are the level of consciousness between feelings and concepts, which use a mixture of mental languages, some of which can be expressed to others, and are clearly defined and others which are neither of these things. 

Concept (noun)
1. An idea of something formed by mentally combining all its characteristics or particulars; a construct.
2. A directly conceived or intuited object of thought.

A concept is a conscious contemplation involving a clearly defined and understood idea that can be expressed using some form of communication.

We do not always think in concepts, we can have vague ideas and feelings about things, however when we begin to reason things out in our minds we work purely in concepts. Arguably it is impossible for us to know if any other beings beyond us are conscious, indeed if we are truly honest with ourselves it is impossible to know anything for certain. The ability to reason however is the clearest indication that something or someone is conscious, although arguably consciousness and self awareness are possible without this ability.

C – The Social Construction of Reality

Argument from Berger & Luckman goes here.
