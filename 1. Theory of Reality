1. Theory of Reality
This will be an essay examining what reality is

A – Reality as a mental construction

What do we mean when we talk about reality? Do our dreams happen in reality? Are memories part of reality? Is there just one real reality? The answer to any of these questions depends on what we define reality as. A good dictionary will give something like the below.

Reality (noun)
1. that which exists, independent of observation.
2. the state of things as they are or appear to be, rather than as one might wish them to be.

It seems when we talk about reality what we often mean is the physical world, the world we experience through our senses in our waking life. This is the world we are gradually beginning to understand and explain using science.

Does this definition helps us answer the question of “Do our dreams happen in reality?” Arguably yes, all dreams take place in reality, everything does. While I am dreaming I'm living a a tree-house with the band Blur, my body is still in reality', but then again is my mind still in reality?

Consider for a moment the things you can see with your eyes at the moment, and indeed everything contained in your field of vision. Compare this to our imaginations of what the vision of an insect might look like

Why do we only see one image instead of two? The reason for this that we do not experience reality as it is. Our eyes provide two streams of raw visual data, but our sense are not just approximations of physical reality in our brain, but a collection of mental concepts by which we understand reality.

It is helpful to think of your brain as a computer, and your mind as one of many programs running on your computer brain. This computer is connected to lots of other pieces of hardware, such as your camera eyes, robot body and microphone ears. For your mind to work with them it needs special software, to stretch the metaphor drivers, to act as a translation service. To interact with them however as well as various drivers your mind also needs special interface software to provides the mental equivalent of a user interface.

Imagine the icons on your desktop PC at the moment. When you place an object in a folder on the screen or empty the waste basket you are under no illusion that somewhere in the workings of your PC a little waste basket or folder actually exists. These symbols make the complex and confusing world of the PC far easier to navigate, even though they are not true representations of the multitude of different binary states of the microchips in our PCs.
