"I would like to start by making a handful of metaphysical assumptions. First that I exist in a physical world, known as the universe above or beyond of which nothing exists. Secondly, while I exist in a single physical world, I am aware of different overlapping ‘realities’ through a combination of my senses, memory and imagination.

The universe has a history that we have gradually begun to uncover, this history is one of a movement from simplicity to complexity, as the right conditions emerge for new more complex systems of existence. While the origins of the universe are not completely understood or easily comprehended, it is most likely that it began roughly 13.7 billion years ago.

I will attempt to quickly  cover the first 10 billion years or so of this 13.7 billion year history breaking it into four sections or ages called The Big Bang, The Birth of Stars, Formation of Planets and Emergence of Sentient Life.

A - The Age of the Big Bang

Extrapolation of the expansion of the universe backwards in time using the theory of general relativity gives us a single point of infinite density and temperature at a finite time. We can wind the clock back no further than approximately 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 seconds before this point. Here in time, before even the first second the nature of the fundamental forces, matter and the rules of physics are beyond our comprehension and the universe is smaller than an atom and hotter than anything we know. This the start of the age of the big bang. After what is thought to be between 0.000000000001 and 0.000001 seconds the fundamental forces of physics as we understand them have begun to take shape as raw energy (which is all that exists at this moment of creation itself) congeals into the fundamental particles we have been newly introduced to through quantum physics. 

It takes around 10 seconds for our universe to arrange it self into a hot dense plasma of nuclei, electrons and photons, this marks the start of what physicists call the photon era. During this era the universe cools allowing for a new more complex arrangement of the subatomic particles driven by the newly established fundamental forces into collections of protons and neutrons surrounded by electrons. We have defined these new more complex arrangements of matter to be atoms, the smallest unit that defines the chemical elements, every substance, all solids, liquids or gas is constructed from atoms.

B - The Age of the Star

With the formation of these atoms we move from the age of the big bang to the age of the star. The universe is now mostly filled with atoms of hydrogen, the rest helium with some trace quantities of other lighter atoms like lithium, Beryllium and Boron. For millions of years our simple universe waited for a new type of interaction between these atoms. 

Gravity is stronger where you have more matter, inevitably then, gravity began to squeeze these atoms together over the millions of years. We don’t know exactly when or how, but roughly 200 million years after the big bang a threshold temperature was passed as these collections of atoms continually grew more and more dense and a new type of interaction, thermonuclear fusion began between the hydrogen and helium in the core of these newly formed stars. While at first only five different chemical elements existed, new chemical elements were formed in stars. Our universe had just taken another leap forward in complexity as stars of various shapes, size and composition eventually forged sixty eight new arrangements of atoms or chemical elements.

C - The Age of the Planets

The third age of the planets began for us in our little patch of creation around 5 billion years ago, after roughly 8 billion years of stars hurling out an abundance of new complex chemical elements. Solar systems were a new complex arrangement of matter that took place when giant clouds of matter came together and exploded into a new star that was surrounded by a solar nebula. These disc shaped clouds of gas and dust which remained after the explosion were where new types of interaction between the chemical elements, not just that which took place in the violent hearts of stars could occur.

In these solar nebula the lighter chemical elements were most often pushed to the furthest reaches of the disc and the heavier remained much closer to the star at the centre. A process of accretion lumped these into small clumps, then whole planetesimals around 10 kilometres in size. Now through occasional collisions these grew at a rate of centimetres per year over millions of of years. A new level of complexity was emerging in the form of planets, great hulking collections of a mishmash of different chemical elements.

Again on these planets new types of interaction between phenomena could take place which had not been possible elsewhere. Climates and ecosystems began to emerges

D - The age of Sentient Life

The age of Sentient Life began around 3.5 billion years ago. It was probably in volcanic vents deep under the sea where the first microbial organisms came together. There is endless speculation about what exactly happened to create the first biological organism, but our existence today proves it must have taken place. This basic sentient life had four qualities:

1. Metabolism, the ability to take in energy from surroundings and keep going.
2. Homoeostasis, the ability to regulate itself and maintain stability.
3. Reproduction, the ability to create copies for preservation and continuation.
4. Adaptation, the ability to change from generation to generation.

Over time these new sentient organisms meant that ‘the age of Sentient Life’ saw the birth of knowledge and learning, as best illustrated by Karl Popper in ‘All Life Is Problem Solving’. This process by which knowledge was created was a 3 step process consisting of:

1: Problem
2: Attempted at solution
3: Elimination

A problem arises when an organism’s expectations prove to have been incorrect. At this stage it will attempt to solve the problem through a series of testing actions. If these testing actions successfully solve the problem they will typically be remembered and repeated if the problem is encountered again. If an organism is too often disappointed in its expectations, it caves in. It cannot solve the problem and perishes. Through the miracle of DNA this knowledge was often recorded and passed down to future generations.

Over 3.5 billion years various nuggets of knowledge were recorded in the DNA of these organisms, and the tree of life developed three main branches. Bacteria, single celled prokaryotic organisms, Archaea another completely separate domain of life, and finally Eukaryota, with complex cells. These Eukaryota can be further divided into Animalia, Fungi, Amoebozoa, Plantae, Archaeplastida, Chromalveolata and Excavata. 


E - the Age of Conscious Life

The ‘Age of Conscious Life’ began as life moved from being simply sentient to being conscious. 

Sentient (adjective)
1. Able to feel, see, hear, smell, or taste.
2. Finely sensitive in perception or feeling.

Conscious (adjective)
1. Aware of one's own existence, sensations, thoughts, surroundings, etc.
2. Capable of thought, will, or perception.

While life has always been sentient to some degree, as even single celled organisms respond to the environment, it is unclear when it became conscious. While it is fairly easy to test for sentience by seeing if something  can confirm its ability to see or hear something, it is much harder to test for consciousness in the same way. Conscious life is able to have thoughts and think in a way that simple sentient life is not. When considering consciousness it is helpful to try to draw a distinction between the overlapping conscious processes of feelings, thoughts and concepts.

Feelings (noun)
1. the general state of consciousness considered independently of particular sensations, thoughts, etc. 
2. a consciousness or vague awareness: a feeling of inferiority.

Feelings are the rawest form of consciousness. I can never sufficiently express to another being what it is to feel lonely or in love, my only hope is that they have had a similar experiences and my be able to relate in this way if I try to explain my feelings to them.

Thought (noun)
1. meditation, contemplation, or recollection: deep in thought.
2. intention, design, or purpose, especially a half-formed or imperfect intention: We had some thought of eating.

Thoughts are a level of more specific contemplation above this. These are the level of consciousness between feelings and concepts, which use a mixture of mental languages, some of which can be expressed to others, and are clearly defined and others which are neither of these things. 

Concept (noun)
1. An idea of something formed by mentally combining all its characteristics or particulars; a construct.
2. A directly conceived or intuited object of thought.

A concept is a conscious contemplation involving a clearly defined and understood idea that can be expressed using some form of communication. The importance of these mental concepts to the development of Homo-Sapiens arguably cannot be overstated, and is examined in some detail by Yuval Harari in Sapens: A Brief History of Human Kind (2014). He examines the modern phenomenon of Peugeot, and questions it's existence.

“In what sense can we say that Peugeot SA (the company's official name) exists? There are many Peugeot vehicles, bet these are obviously not the company. Even if every Peugeot in the world were simultaneously junked and sold for scrap metal, Peugeot SA would not disappear. It would continue to manufacture new cars and issue its annual report. The company owns factories, machinery and showrooms, and employs mechanics, accounts and secretaries, but all these together do not comprise Peugeot. A disaster might kill every single one of Peugeot's employees, and go on to destroy all of it's assembly lines and executive offices. Even the, the company could borrow money, fire new employees, build new factorise and buy new machinery. Peugeot has managers and shareholders, but neither do they constitutes the company. All the managers could be dismissed and all it's shares sold, but the company itself would remain intact. 

It doesn't mean that Peugeot SA is invulnerable or immortal. If a judge were to mandate the dissolution of the company, it's factorise would remain standing and it's workers, accounts, managers and shareholders would continue to live – but Peugeot SA would immediately vanish. In short, Peugeot SA seems to have no essential connection to the physical world. Does it really exist?

Peugeot is a figment of our collective imagination. Lawyers call this a 'legal fiction'. It can't be pointed at' it is not a physical object. But it exists as a legal entity.”

An aspect Yuval focuses on from this point is how these legal fictions as he calls them allow Homo-Sapiens to cooperate in very large numbers.  It is also worth nothing however that it was only when life became conscious to the degree that awareness beyond the level of simple feelings was possible that it began to learn and acquire knowledge though the more complex scientific model.

F - The language & scientific model emerge

Karl Popper argued that scientific knowledge was acquired through the use of a four stage model as set out below.

1: Original Problem
2: Formation of Tentative Theories.
3: Attempts at Elimination (through experimental testing).  
4: New Problems (which arise when experiments partially fail or when the problem is solved and a new one arises).

Maybe organic life reached a level of consciousness that used this model of acquiring knowledge when homo habilis first appeared on the Animalia branch of life anything from 2.3 to 1.4 million years ago. The Natufian hunter gather people who existed roughly 12,300 to 10,800 years ago in Lebanon, the first life forms to use sickle blades to harvest cereals were almost certainly using this new model of acquiring knowledge, as such tools were unlikely to have been developed using simple trial and error. 

The four stage model of scientific knowledge is closely tied to the complex language required to form tentative theories. Before delving any further it is worth examining exactly what we mean when we are talking about language.

Language (noun)
1. Communication of thoughts and feelings through a system of arbitrary signals, such as voice sounds, gestures, or written symbols.
2. words of a particular kind.

Language is an ability seemingly unique to homo sapiens to acquire and use complex systems of communication, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The assertion that language is unique to homo sapiens has been disputed as animals use verbal communication to indicate danger, food, sexual arousal and a host of other things. They have a systems of communication that arguably include nouns, adjectives and verbs. For example a Meerkat can communicate the concepts of not just danger but specifically an aerial predator with either low, high or medium urgency or a terrestrial predator with low, high or medium urgency. Bottlenose dolphins discuss their names, ages, gender and location with each other across the miles of the ocean. Some people argue that a distinction however can be drawn between communication and language. To qualify as a language the system of communication must meet these six criteria.

1. Arbitrariness: there is no rational relationship between a sound or sign and its meaning, e.g. there is nothing intrinsically "housy" about the word "house".
2. Discreteness: language is composed of small, repeatable parts, discrete units, that are used in combination to create meaning.
3. Displacement: languages can be used to communicate ideas about things that are not in the immediate vicinity either spatially or temporally.
4. Duality of patterning: the smallest meaningful units (words, morphemes) consist of sequences of units without meaning (speech sounds morphemes). This is also known as called Double articulation.
5. Productivity: users can understand and create an indefinitely large number of utterances.
6. Semanticity: specific signals have specific meanings.

While some animal forms of communication may occasionally display all 6 of these requirements for definition as a language, none have the depth of vocabulary historic or modern human languages have. It is certainly true to say that complex language is unique to people, even if language is not.

G - The Birth of Philosophy 

Now we have a clear idea of language we can look at the birth of what we might call philosophy, that took place during the ‘Age of Conscious Life’. An octopus may be using the four stage scientific model of acquiring knowledge when it figures out how to unscrew a jar to get to the treat inside, or a crow when it bends wire to use as a tool. However without a complex shared social language, stages two and three are always undertaken by single individuals, with the through process hidden from the rest of the world and other forms of conscious life that might exist. With a complex shared social language stages two and three are transformed.

1: Original Problem
2: Formation of Tentative Theories (through critical discussion).
3: Attempts at Elimination (through critical discussion, and collaboratively concived experimental testing).  
4: New Problems (which can now also arise from the critical discussion of theories).

When complex language is used by individuals to share their ideas with others, multiplying the mental processing power applied to the formation and elimination of theories, we see philosophy taking place.

Philosophy (noun)

1. The study of the nature, causes, or principles of reality, knowledge, or values, based on logical reasoning.
2. A set of ideas about how to do something or how to live.

Philosophy is best defined as quite simply thinking carried out where individuals are able to show their working. Once someone is thinking (not feeling or just having thoughts, but specifically thinking about something) in a way that can be clearly explained to another individual you are arguably engaging in a form of philosophy. It is possible to philosophise about if wine or beer is better or indeed no alcohol at all is preferable. It is also possible to develop a philosophy about how to travel from your house to a friends, and what is the fastest or most pleasant route. Clearly this is a very wide definition and means all fields of knowledge involve a degree of philosophy.

H - The Age of Civilisation

As with the ‘Age of Sentient Life’ and the ‘Age of Conscious Life’ it is hard to draw a line in history and say this is when the ‘Age of Civilisation’ began. It was roughly 50,000 years ago when we guess humans developed full behavioural modernity, including language, music and other cultural universals. When did we progress from just being a community or society into a civilisation, and what do we mean by these terms?

I think we can draw a line between a community and a society based on the number and complexity of the rules in existence. A community does not have the abundance of all encompassing rules that a society has. A collection of individuals who simply happen to share the same space and some basic laws and customs is a community, it becomes a society when those individuals all share a large number of laws and customs that permeate most if not all aspects of life. 

Just as the change from community into society is rather subjective, so to arguably is the change from society to civilisation. We could simple argue that a society becomes a civilisation once laws are set out clearly using written language. If we draw the line for the start of ‘the age of Civilisation’ when the first written laws were established by people, we can only say with any confidence that it began roughly 5,000 years ago.

This could have been in the Jemdet Nasr period from 3,100-2,900 BCE, in Mesopotamia, where centralised buildings, administrative cuneiform tablets and seals suggest settlements were very organised, complete with a central administration regulating the economy. Similarly in 3,600 BCE the Egyptian people along the Nile River had already become a unified cultural and economic domain, with a system of writing already developed denoting 200 symbols representing speech sounds and concepts. We could be being presumptuous and unnecessarily vague in calling a group of individuals with written laws a civilisation however, maybe a better definition of a civilisation would be a society with a written constitution.

Constitution (noun)
1. A body of fundamental principles or established precedents of a nation, state, or social group that determine the powers and duties of the government and guarantee certain rights to the people in it.
2. The system of beliefs and laws by which a country, state, or organisation is governed.

The earliest evidence for a known constitution was found in Mesopotamia, dating from 2,300 BCE. A constitution can be either one document or a series of documents, and can contain some unwritten aspects such as the United Kingdoms constitution. These unwritten constitutions rely on the observation of precedents, royal prerogatives, custom and tradition (such as always holding the General Election on a Thursday). 

I - The Social Construction of Reality

As we move into the ‘Age of Civilisation’ it is worth further unpacking my ontology. As well as making the handful of metaphysical assumptions mentioned earlier and taking the history of the universe I have given as correct I would ask you to consider that the world can be broken into two categories of things. Physical objects and Imaginary abstracts

Physical phenomenon - These are the physical things we can detect or infer using tools, logic and our senses. The understanding of these phenomena is what concerns most physicists.

Imaginary abstracts – These are mental concepts we hold in our minds.

It is worth noting that we as conscious individual's view the world through a lenses of imaginary socially constructed imaginary abstracts, as put forward by Berger & Luckman in the Social Construction of Reality. The work of Berger & Luckman is rooted heavily in the idea's of 'bundle theory' developed by David Hume.

According to bundle theory, something consists of its properties and nothing else: thus neither can there be an object without properties nor can one even conceive of such an object. When thinking of an apple we are compelled to think of maybe its colour, its shape, the fact that it is a kind of fruit, its cells, its taste, or at least one or more of its properties. Thus, the theory asserts that the apple is no more than the collection of various properties. In particular, there is no phenomena in which the properties are inherent or that has no properties.

Berger & Luckman ultimately argue that 'properties' are assigned to reality from our socially constructed languages, and that experiencing reality requires us to provide properties to any and all phenomena we encounter. An apple does not have the properties 'red' or 'juicy', but rather observers who already believe in a concept called 'red' use that concept to experience an apple as 'red'. 'Red' cannot be distilled from an apple because 'Red' is an abstraction from other experiences and not an innate property an apple might contain, indeed nothing contains any innate properties, all properties are a social construction, albeit one that may be a unique social construction to the conscious individual.

J – avoiding a metaphysical existential crisis

To experience, describe or picture something in your mind without these 'Imaginary Abstracts' is frankly impossible. Indeed breaking the world into physical phenomenon and imaginary abstracts may be incorrect, as arguably physical phenomenon are simply one type of imaginary abstract.

At the start of this piece I started by making a set of metaphysical assumptions, the most important one of which was:

I exist in a physical world, known as the universe above or beyond of which nothing exists. 

It is unavoidable that I ask you to assume that you too exist in a shared physical world with me, even if we experience this world through a combination of either shared or unique imaginary abstracts, about which their can be no real certainty. Further discussion on this topic I fear is an amazingly fascinating yet pointless distraction from which no benefit can be gained.

Once we accept this assumption we can in fact conclude that all imaginary abstracts are drawn from our experience of this ultimate reality. Consider even the most abstract of concepts such as beauty, justice, numbers or logic. It is impossible to properly describe these things without some reference to our shared ultimate physical reality.

Only sensory experience can be beautiful. Only principles that can be theoretically applied to our shared ultimate physical reality or actions can be described as just or justice. Only through reference to the physical world can we arrive at the starting point for even the most abstract contemplations of numbers and logic.
K – Imaginary abstracts in civilisations

These Imaginary abstracts take on a new meaning in the civilised world, where they can be considered to exist on a scale of formal and informal depending on how clearly they are defined by a civilisation, and multiple scales if they are defined by more than one civilisation. While this is a sliding scale, I will describe a phenomena as formal if it is clearly defined in writing, as a a legal fiction if it is clearly defined in writing by a civilisation with a constitutional apparatus.

By this logic no legal fictions exist in societies or communities. For example in one society the funeral ritual for someone killed while hunting maybe to place their body beneath any olive tree with a stone tool. This would be less formal than the burial ritual in another society where it is written on the chiefs wall in symbolic language that the bodies of those killed while hunting should be buried beneath specific olive tree with the stone tool made by their mother, on a night when the moon is full. However both these rituals would not be considered legal fictions.

In is only when funeral practices are set out clearly in written language, in a system of rules that is ultimately complex enough to define as a constitution that we can say they become a legal fiction. Thus no legal fiction can exist outside of civilisation.

It is worth noting At times multiple societies or civilisations may define things very differently, for example one society may define a tree as the funeral tree while another society defines it as the tree that needs to be felled for a new road. Once civilisation may consider an execution an act of justice, while another may feel the same is a moral outrage and act of war.

L - The Birth of the State

During ‘the age of Civilisation’ around 500 BCE to 500 CE we saw these civilisations become states. 

State (noun)
1. a nation or territory considered as an organized political community under one government.
2. a compulsory political organization with a centralized government that maintains a monopoly of the legitimate use of force within a certain geographical territory.

States began to build empires of unprecedented size both in the number of people who lived in under them and the geographical reach of their civilisations over the thousand years from 500 BCE to 500 CE. Roughly 3 million people had lived as hunter gatherers from 35,000 BCE, but a combination of around 50 to 60 million people lived under the combined eastern and western Roman Empire of 400 CE. They had well trained armies, unifying ideologies and the advanced bureaucracies required for organisation of a large domain. 

During its spread driving ‘the of Civilisation’ the various and numerous nation states that have existed have been controlled by a host of different types of government. 

Government (noun)
1. The group of people with the authority to govern a country or state; a particular ministry in office.
2. The system by which a state or community is governed:

The different types of government that have so far existed can be classified by how many individuals take part in government, either as a monarchic for one single individual, oligarchic for a few individuals and democratic for  many individuals. There are no hard and fast rules for definition beyond, although terms like Autocracy, Constitutional Monarchy and Aristocracy are used by political scientists to refer to systems of government have have been examined, although they are are all contested terms for which many various conflicting definitions exist.

M – Maths & True Science begins 

Ultimately however, whether the government consists of a lone warrior priest king or 543 representatives elected by 800 million Indian citizens individuals have had to make decisions regarding how they are governed in a variety of formal roles such as subjects, electors or kings. 

While all manner of heuristics and superstition have informed these individuals, the academic sciences have arguably been the most useful source of information for individuals when faced with making a decision.

Science (noun) 
1. A branch of knowledge or study dealing with a body of facts or truths systematically arranged and showing the operation of general laws.
2. Systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation.

Karl Popper described any knowledge gained through the four stage model he set out as scientific knowledge, and the model itself as the scientific process. This definition is arguably to wide however, to truly qualify as a science a discipline has to involve mathematics as well as language when constructing tentative theories and attempting their falsification. 

Interestingly organisms awareness of mathematics could well pre-date anything we would consider the beginning of the intelligent life, or even hominids themselves. Prehistoric people certainly may have been aware of counting, as shown by the tallies found on bones. More complex mathematics didn’t appear until around 3000 BCE though with the Babylonians and Egyptians who used arithmetic, algebra and geometry for taxation and other financial calculations along with building and construction.

Mathematics (noun)
1. A group of related disciplines, including algebra, geometry, and calculus, concerned with the study of number, quantity, shape, and space and their interrelationships by using a specialised notation.
2. Mathematical operations and processes involved in the solution of a problem or study of some scientific field

Some people would argue incorrectly that maths is simply another language. This would be incorrect however, as all languages are simply methods of communication, and do not adhere to unchanging logical principles. The meaning of words will change over time and with context. However the number 1027 will always be 1027.

Mathematics refers to the totally abstract, but initially intuitively logical world of numbers and mathematical operations. These numbers can be classed as 

Counting numbers. 

Integer numbers.

Rational numbers.

Real numbers.

Complex numbers. 
(Complete later)

While there are a number of different mathematical operations, such as the integration or rearranging of an equation these are all rooted in and simple (and complex at times!!) variations and reversals of the two basic operations of addition and multiplication.

Arguably it was only when the four stage model, philosophy and mathematics are combined that the scientific process of understanding reality is taking place. We cannot pin point when this first took place, but we can certainly see where great leaps forward were made using it, from the atom bomb to the catapult and they pyramids, this academic science has granted homo-sapiens immense power.

O – Growing more complexity

P – Sustainability
