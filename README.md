Ontology (noun
1. a branch of metaphysics concerned with the nature and relations of being.
2. a particular theory about the nature of being or the kinds of things that have existence .

I would like to start by making four assumptions, which are as  non-controversial as any certain belief can be. While each point may well deserves to be covered in more detail that I have here, as none of these points is the focal point of my work I feel I can be brief.

1. I exist and am aware of numerous various realities though a combination of my senses, memory and imagination.

2. There is a universe comprised of elementary or fundamental particles such as quarks and leptons, which go on to make up neutrons, electrons and protons which in turn make up atoms and the basic chemical elements. 

3. I exist in and am aware of various aspects of this universe through my senses. 

4. Other individuals who also seemingly also possess senses, imagination and memory share this material universe with myself

5. While this reality is arguably objective, under any any thorough examination that has been undertaken by myself or others it ultimately appears to have a seemingly nebulous nature.

6. My understanding of all realities, including the material universe of my senses is subjective, and ultimately a social construction.

Our shared universe has a history that we have gradually begun to uncover as species and civilisation, and while the origins of the universe are not understood or indeed easily comprehended, it is almost certain that it began roughly 13.7 billion years ago. These 13.7 billion years can be divided into 5 ages, the first three of which we’ll cover briefly. 

The first age, the ‘Age of the Big Bang’ was the mind bending era of the planck, grand unification, electroweak, Inflationary, quark, hadron and lepton epochs, all measured in 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000ths of a second which ended with the photon epoch. The photon epoch started roughly 10 seconds after the birth of the universe and ended after around 400,000 years when the universe had cooled to a temperature where the first atoms, mainly helium and hydrogen had begun to form.

The second age, the ‘Age of the Stars’ began as gravity crushed these new atoms into stars around 400,000 years after the moment of creation. Once these stars eventually consumed most of the hydrogen inside them through nuclear fusion almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthsis, and sometimes supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes. These new chemical elements began to spread throughout the universe.

The third age, the ‘Age of our Solar System’ began around 5 billion years ago when a giant cloud of matter came together and exploded into a new star, our Sun. The chemically rich left overs of this explosion made up the 8 planets in our solar system. The dawn of the fourth age, the ‘Age of Life on Earth’, seems a prudent place to begin working on an Epistemology, alongside this Ontology.

Epistemology (noun)
1. a branch of philosophy that investigates the origin, nature, methods, and limits of human knowledge.
2.  the study or a theory of the nature and grounds of knowledge especially with reference to its limits and validity

The fourth age, the ‘Age of Life on Earth’ began around 3.5 billion years ago. It was probably in volcanic vents deep under the sea saw the first microbial organisms came together. Basic life forms have four qualities:

1. Metabolism, the ability to take in energy from surroundings and keep going.
2. Homoeostasis, the ability to regulate itself and maintain stability.
3. Reproduction, the ability to create copies for preservation and continuation.
4. Adaptation, the ability to change from generation to generation.

Over time these new organisms meant that the ‘Age of Life’ saw the birth of knowledge and learning, as best illustrated by Karl Popper in ‘All Life Is Problem Solving’. The process to create knowledge was a 3 step process:

1: Problem
2: Attempted at solution
3: Elimination

A problem arises when an organism’s conscious or unconscious expectations prove to have been incorrect. At this stage it will attempt (again consciously or unconsciously) to solve the problem through a series of testing actions. If the testing actions successfully solve the problem they will typically be remembered and repeated if the problem is encountered again. If an organism is too often disappointed in its expectations, it caves in. It cannot solve the problem and perishes. Through the miracle of DNA this knowledge was often recorded and passed down to future generations.

Over 3.5 billion years various nuggets of knowledge were recorded in the DNA of these organisms and the tree of life developed three main branches. Bacteria, single celled prokaryotic organisms, Archaea another completely separate domain of life, and finally Eukaryota, with complex cells. These Eukaryota can be further divided into Animalia, Fungi, Amoebozoa, Plantae, Archaeplastida, Chromalveolata and Excavata. 

The fifth age, the ‘Age of Civilisation’, arguably began when life began to learn and acquire knowledge through the more complex four stage model shown below. 

1: Original Problem
2: Formation of Tentative Theories.
3: Attempts at Elimination (through critical discussion, including experimental testing).  
4: New Problems (which arise from the critical discussion of our theories).

Maybe life began to use this model when homo habilis first appeared on the Animalia branch of life anything from 2.3 to 1.4 million years ago. It was certainly doing so to some degree when the people of Mesopotamia (modern day Iraq) started writing down words, not just numbers around 3100-2900 BCE roughly 5000 years ago. 

This model is forever wedded to the complex language (which could predate written language, or even the hominids we have descended from) required to form tentative theories. It is also arguably closely tied to mathematics. Organisms awareness of mathematics could well predate anything we would consider the beginning of the ‘Age of Civilisation’, or even hominids themselves. Prehistoric people certainly may have been aware of counting, as shown by the tallies found on bones. More complex mathematics didn’t appear until around 3000 BCE with the Babylonians and Egyptans who used arithmetic, algebra and geometry for taxation and other financial calculations along with building and construction.

Before delving any further into what changes took place in moving from the ‘Age of Life on Earth’ to the ‘Age of Civilisation’ however it is worth examining exactly what we mean when we are talking about language and mathematics.

Language (noun)
1. Communication of thoughts and feelings through a system of arbitrary signals, such as voice sounds, gestures, or written symbols.
2. words of a particular kind.

Language is an ability seemingly unique to homo sapiens to acquire and use complex systems of communication, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The assertion that language is unique to homo sapiens has been disputed as animals use verbal communication to indicate danger, food, sexual arousal and a host of other things. They have a systems of communication that arguably include nouns, adjectives and verbs. For example a Meerkat can communicate the concepts of not just danger but specifically an aerial predator with either low, high or medium urgency or a terrestrial predator with low, high or medium urgency. Bottlenose dolphins discuss their names, ages, gender and location with each other across the miles of the ocean. 

Some people argue that a distinction however can be drawn between communication and language. To qualify as a language the system of communication must meet these six criteria.

1. Arbitrariness: there is no rational relationship between a sound or sign and its meaning, e.g. there is nothing intrinsically "housy" about the word "house".
2. Discreteness: language is composed of small, repeatable parts, discrete units, that are used in combination to create meaning.
3. Displacement: languages can be used to communicate ideas about things that are not in the immediate vicinity either spatially or temporally.
4. Duality of patterning: the smallest meaningful units (words, morphemes) consist of sequences of units without meaning (speech sounds morphemes). This is also known as called Double articulation.
5. Productivity: users can understand and create an indefinitely large number of utterances.
6. Semanticity: specific signals have specific meanings.

While some animal forms of communication may occasionally display all 6 of these requirements for definition as a language, none have the depth of vocabulary human languages have. It is certainly true to say that complex language is unique to people.

Mathematics (noun)
1. A group of related sciences, including algebra, geometry, and calculus, concerned with the study of number, quantity, shape, and space and their interrelationships by using a specialised notation.
2. Mathematical operations and processes involved in the solution of a problem or study of some scientific field
3. The study of the measurement, relationships, and properties of quantities and sets, using numbers and symbols. Arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and calculus are branches of mathematics.

Some people would argue incorrectly that maths is simply another language. This would be incorrect however, as all language refers to specific things and concepts, rooted ultimately in one of the realities we experience. While language may refer to more abstract concepts such as justice or love, these are all rooted in an experienced reality. To demonstrate this principle try imagining something described using non-mathematical terms that is totally abstract, rather than simply imaginary.

Mathematics refers to the totally abstract, but initially intuitively logical world of numbers and mathematical operations. These numbers can be classed as 

Counting numbers. 

Integer numbers.

Rational numbers.

Real numbers.

Complex numbers. 
(Complete later)

While there are a number of different mathematical operations, such as the integration or rearranging of an equation these are all rooted in and simple (and complex at times!!) variations and reversals of the two basic operations of addition and multiplication.

Games


While arguably the dawn of civilisation started with complex language and thought, which in turn lead to complex systems of human organisation, another indicator may be the advent of games. The oldest game we know 


CRAP NOT USED BUT MAYBE USEFUL

Lets try to do a better job of answering the question “How many languages are there?” To do so, I think we need to do a better job of asking the question. As we have asked the question in English, so many assumptions have been made, that we need to unmake to have a chance of answering this question correctly. First of all there is an assumption that we are asking about the here  and now in the question rather than at another specific point in history, and along with this assumption is a lack of clarification if we are also asking about languages in the past. 





“How many languages are there?”

According to wikipedia attempts to estimate the number of languages in the world have varied between 5,000 and 7,000 depending on how you draw a distinction between a language and a dialect. Is English one or two languages with UK English and American English for example. Also there are a number of other problems such as do we count written and speaking languages together or separately. UK and US English are spelled differently, but spoken much more similarly, although the words have different meaning, for example pants and side walk. What about languages that are not written or spoken such as sign language?  Is sign language a separate language? What about Morse code, or semaphore? What about dead languages? If no one still speaks the language do we still count it?
